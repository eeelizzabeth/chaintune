# JBCalendarDatePicker
A replacement for UIDatePicker made for Catalyst.

This is still a work in progress, there are bugs, and although it's written to work with different calendar systems and locales, it's not guaranteed to work correctly with everything!

## Installation

To install, add the source to the top of your podfile:

`source 'https://github.com/joshbirnholz/JBPodSpecs.git'`

Then add this pod to your targets:

`pod 'JBCalendarDatePicker'`

## Use

There are two classes you can use: `JBDatePickerViewController` and `JBCalendarViewController`.

They are both similar to `UIDatePicker`, and their `date`, `minimumDate`, `maximumDate`, `calendar`, and `locale` properties can be configured in the same way. Configure them before presenting either of the view controllers.

`JBDatePickerViewController` also has a `datePickerMode` property, although `UIDatePicker.Mode.countDownTimer` is not supported.

### JBDatePickerViewController

`JBDatePickerViewController` displays labels showing its represented date and allows the user to use the keyboard to enter a date. When the user clicks on the date portion, the view controller presents its own `JBCalendarViewController`. You can allow the user to select a date, time, or both, by setting the `datePickerMode` property.

```Swift
import JBCalendarDatePicker

class ViewController: UIViewController {

	var datePicker: JBDatePickerViewController!
	
	override func viewDidLoad() {
		super.viewDidLoad()
		
		let datePicker = JBDatePickerViewController()
		view.addSubview(datePicker.view)
		addChild(datePicker)
		datePicker.didMove(toParent: self)
		self.datePicker = datePicker

		// Configure the datePicker's properties
	}
}
```

Or use it from a storyboard. Drag a Container View onto your storyboard. Change the view controller's class to `JBDatePickerViewController`. Give the embed segue an identifier, and then capture a reference to it:

```Swift
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
	if segue.identifier == "Embed Date Picker", let destination = segue.destination as? JBDatePickerViewController {
		self.datePicker = destination
		
		// Configure the datePicker's properties
	}
}
```

### JBCalendarViewController

`JBCalendarViewController` is just the calendar, without the labels.

The view controller tries to present itself as a popover automatically, so be sure to set the `popoverPresentationController`'s `barButtonItem` property or the `sourceView` and `sourceRect` properties.

```Swift
@IBOutlet func buttonPressed(_ sender: UIBarButtonItem) {
	let calendarPicker = JBCalendarViewController()
	calendarPicker.popoverPresentationController?.barButtonItem = sender
	
	// Configure the calendar's properties
	
	present(calendarPicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```
There is also a `JBCalendarViewControllerDelegate` protocol.

```Swift
public protocol JBCalendarViewControllerDelegate: class {
	func calendarViewControllerDateChanged(_ calendarViewController: JBCalendarViewController)
	func calendarViewControllerWillDismiss(_ calendarViewController: JBCalendarViewController)
	func calendarViewControllerDidDismiss(_ calendarViewController: JBCalendarViewController)
}
```
